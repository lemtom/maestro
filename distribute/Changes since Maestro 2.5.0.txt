These instructions only apply to version 2.5.0.82+. Previous versions differ a bit due to being 32 bit per default.

Install instruction (.msi)
===================
0: Install Java (64 bit) from https://java.com
1: Run the .msi file
2: Enjoy.
3: Notice this will uninstall any older version of Maestro you have installed. (but not versions that was unpacked from zip)


Install instruction (.zip)
===================
0: Install Java (64 bit) from https://java.com
1: Copy the content of this ZIP into a random new folder.
2: Double click on Maestro.jar or AbcPlayer.jar to start. Or use the bat files.
(3): Make a Windows shortcut to 'Start Maestro.bat' and one for 'Start AbcPlayer.bat' in the unzipped folder.


Getting 32/64 bit Java
======================
You can have both 32 and 64 bit Java installed at same time, as long as you don't install them same place.
When you click the download link in java.com it will give you the version that match your browser. This is usually the 64 bit version unless you use a very old browser.
To get the other version you might have to search a bit on java.com.


Starting from command prompt
============================
- Use command-line prompt: java -jar -d64 Maestro.jar
    If only 32 bit Java is installed, then it will complain.

Maestro upgrades by Aifel of Laurelin, Elamond of Landroval and Karloman
================
Version 2.5.0.117
- Ability to customize instrument names for default part naming.

Version 2.5.0.116
- Added an Abc Merge Tool. It can takes multiple single-part ABC files and merge them into one multi-part ABC song.
- Added an option to section editor to reset volumes on source notes (e.g. midi notes),
    so seen from Maestro there will be no volume variations in the midi file in the specified section (beside from section changes).
- Add ability to reset setting pages. Each page has gotten a Reset Page button.
- Add part count indicator to Song Parts title text.
- Option in section editor to set all note volumes to default.
- Added a warning if you try to open a MSX project file created on a newer version of Maestro with an older version.
- Fix that when installing Maestro fresh, the drummap could be empty.
- Maestro can now be used while Section and Tune editors are open.
- Trim non-active parts from ABC export.
- The part list can now be resized.

Version 2.5.0.115
- Space can now be used to play/pause.
- It is now again possible to start multiple Maestro or AbcPlayers.
- AbcPlayer can now export MP3 on Linux and MacOS also.
- Internal refactoring and update java target to JRE 8.
- New menu option to save a midi, which will expand tracks to only have 1 instrument per track.
    After saving the new midi, it will ask if you would like to load the new expanded midi.
- Add support for using pattern to define export ABC filename. 

Version 2.5.0.114
- Fix missing file in MSI install.

Version 2.5.0.113
- Added flat dark and flat light user-interface modes.

Version 2.5.0.112
- Fixed an issue in AbcPlayer where it would think a note was shorter than 0.06s, but it was due to precision error in 17th decimal place.

Version 2.5.0.111
- Added option to convert most extended ascii and diacritical marks in ABC to simple latin letters and remove unicode chars.
    This will be enabled by default.
    It is useful for most LUA based songbooks that have trouble with many non-latin letters.

Version 2.5.0.110
- Fixed that some unicode chars in filenames could prevent an already running Maestro/Abcplayer from opening the file by double-clicking in Windows.

Version 2.5.0.109
- Fixed a regression in the auto part numbering scheme introduced in v2.5.0.102
- When changing an instrument to another that has same number scheme, for example Lute of Ages to Basic lute, the part number will now not change.
- A fix for that when switching auto part numbering scheme it would sometimes not convert all instruments to new scheme.

Version 2.5.0.108
- Ignore when receiving data that is not a filename. This fixes the odd error messages that could pop up. 

Version 2.5.0.105
- Made the bar lines inside edited sections be greenish. When the bar lines is dense it can otherwise be hard to see edited areas.
- Fixed that the exe files was not removed from ZIP distribution.

Version 2.5.0.104
- Removed the exe files, it will now use the bat files instead.
    This should solve the issue some users have experienced with running out of memory.
    The first time you run Maestro or AbcPlayer, your firewall might ask you to allow Java to connect to network. You can allow or disallow, it does not use Internet, so either should work.
      Technical explanation: It use ports locally for passing file path to already running program when opening files, hence why firewall asks.

Version 2.5.0.103
- Doubled the number of available sections in section-editor and tune-editor. Moved the help text into a tooltip, just hover mouse over 'Help'.

Version 2.5.0.102
- When manually changing a part number so that the numbering scheme no longer applies for 1 or more parts,
    those parts will not be auto assigned new numbers but will keep their numbers. 

Version 2.5.0.101
- Made sure polyphony counter gets reset when switching to original preview.
- Added option to choose MIDI playback device.
    If a device is selected but no longer connected, default will do the playback.
- Added support for ports (which is not a part of the midi standard).
    Programs such as Cakewalk and Musescore export those kind of midi.
    Maestro default midi device still wont playback the midi correct, but at least the tracks instrument names should now be correct.

Version 2.5.0.100
- Added a Tune editor that allows setting tempo changes and seminote transposing for certain bars.
    Works like Section Editor and copy/paste works from section editor too.
    The button is marked "T" and will become green when edits has been made.
    The tempo panel above the tracks will also show the edits with a dark green color. But neither
    the tempo-lines or the tempo-indicator will change, it will still show the original tempo.
    Beware of pitfalls:
      Setting too high or too low tempo, might cause a popup warning that tempo at a certain points get beyond the limit.
      If setting a high tempo, it might also pop up a warning that meter denominator is too high. If that happens, either
      reduce the tempo again, or set the denominator to a lower value. For example if it was 4/4 then you can try 2/2 or 4/2.

Version 2.5.0.99
- MIDIs with low time resolution that can not be halved many times, will now be PPQ upscaled when Maestro loads the MIDI.
    If you have in the past exported ABCs where the timing sounded off, it is recommended to re-export them from midi with this version.
    For some midi with this issue, export were not affected though. And for some only normal rhythm was affected while swing was okay. And some opposite.
- Fixed that when the midi had a track where ASCII control character(s) was used, it would save a project file that could not again be opened.
    The project file saved is now xml v1.1 instead of v1.0, which allows reading of such chars.
    If you have some old project files that you could save but not open again afterwards, just edit it and change 1.0 to 1.1 in the first line.
- Added bat files to the MSI installer also.
- Added German and French nicknames for instruments. These are used when loading up old ABCs into Maestro and AbcPlayer, plus in the Numerate button.
    Thanks to Brago and Thalvo for helping.

Version 2.5.0.98
- Fix again that drum panel was still misaligned by 4 pixels.

Version 2.5.0.97
- Fix that drum panel was misaligned
- Improved Abcplayer ability to verify FFmpeg file.

Version 2.5.0.96
- Introduced combine priorities.
    When using Mix Timings it allows to set which tracks are more important with regards to rhythm,
    when you combine multiple tracks into a part. When this is enabled and tracks are combined,
    a checkbox will appear for each combined track for increasing priority.

Version 2.5.0.95
- Fix that Maestro would output ABC timestamps at each bar that did not take tempo change into consideration.
- Set a limit to the amount that Maestro adjust long note breaks to fit on bars.
- Add .bat files to the zip release that will ensure that if you have both 32 and 64 bit Java installed, that it starts the 64 bit version.
- AbcPlayer can now use FFmpeg to make MP3 files.
    There is a 3 second timer, from clicking the menu till you get dialog up, just like for LAME.
    I used v4.4.1-release-full, but newer versions should work too, and vX.X.X-release-essentials versions also, they are less bloated.
    This is not an endorsement for FFmpeg from me. I have no idea which version your going to get,
    if you trust it, use it. If you don't, don't use it. Don't blame me, I just choose it due to its versatility and popularity.
- When starting Maestro with 32 bit Java, there will now pop up a warning.
- Added heap memory usage to Maestro about dialog.
    If you should run out of memory using 64 bit java, try use the bat files that came with the ZIP or double click the jars directly.
    The sign you are running out of memory is usually that the interface starts to get drawn weirdly and/or Maestro acts up.

Version 2.5.0.94
- Added a note button next to zoom button. The note you write will be saved in the msx project file, not the abc file.
    You can use it to keep notes of why you arranged it a certain way,
    or what still needs to be done. Or to keep track of the lyrics.
- A 99% fix for Soundblaster Audigy 5 not respecting master volume setting when skipping in certain MIDIs.
- Added a Numerate button to auto assign numbers to identical instrument part titles
    So "Lute" and "Lute 4" will become "Lute 1" and "Lute 2".
    It doesn't work when part titles is not in English or if an instrument name is not recognized.
    Basically it does not attempt to modify or count parts that does not start with an instrument name and then ends or have a number at the end. 

Version 2.5.0.93
- A more elegant solution to not allowing to delete last part.
- Disable Close Project menu item, when nothing is opened.
- Add copy/paste buttons to section-editor. Works across parts. Will only copy the bar starts and ends plus if they are enabled.
- If open a msx file and had to find the midi file in another than the original location, then the project will now be marked as modified.
- When opening a MIDI it will now do a better job of guessing the artist and title from the filename. Sometimes it might switch them around though.
- When suggesting an abc filename, it will now remove extra dots, as songbook do not like them.
- Add an export timestamp to the abc header, like this example: %%export-timestamp 2022-10-22 08:26:11

Version 2.5.0.92
- Added an Edit menu item for (de)selecting all tracks in AbcPlayer.
- Added a Recent Opened files menu item in AbcPlayer.
- Prevent clearing tracks and mess up MIDI player by not having an abc part selected (does not matter if its assigned or not),
    so often only MIDI drum tracks would play. Wouldn't mess up ABC preview playing though.
    This is the new mechanisms:
    - Prevented Delete part button from deleting the last remaining part from the list.
    - When deleting the first part in the list, the new first part will now be properly selected.
    - If CTRL-clicking the selected part, the first part will now be selected, so a part is always selected.

Version 2.5.0.91
- Support for very long MIDIs.
    Tested up to 2 hours and 11 minutes, but probably can handle much more.

Version 2.5.0.90
- Fix for missing "Delete" part button on MacOS.
    It will make the left panels wide enough to show LM Bassoon as a part. Which will then also make room for the delete button.
- LCM algorithm improvement for mix timing. Result should be the same, but slightly faster.

Version 2.5.0.89
- Attempt for fixing missing "delete part" button on MacOS. Didn't pan out.

Version 2.5.0.88
- Notes in non-sustained parts that has already been started, will now get very high priority for pruning subsequent tied notes.
    This is due to some experiments in lotro that shows that they do not count for the max 6 limit.
    
Version 2.5.0.87
- Special release that supports songs over 2 hours. This is only in this release, next release will be normal again.  

Version 2.5.0.86
- Refined the note pruning algorithm for staying under 6 simultaneous notes per instrument. Done in cooperation with Jersiel.
- Removed the "Show discarded notes in yellow" feature.
    It could get confusing when only part of a note got discarded, but the UI would show entire note as discarded.

Version 2.5.0.85
- Made extra check to be sure no duplicate drum notes are output as lotro will accept them but not double play them.

Version 2.5.0.84
- Added 8 new drum sounds that each is a combi of 2 drum sounds, their names start with "Xtra".
    The sounds are some bass, snares and a crash cymbal. Jersiel supplied the combis, except one.
    Note that because they are 2 sounds, they will sound louder, and will eat into the 6 note limit fast, plus add to the 64 full song limit also.
    Note pruning down to 6 for a part, might split them up too, prune one of its sounds but not the other.
    So be very mindful of how the track(s) and song is made when considering to use these.
    Its mostly a convenience for small bands. If you need combis and have band members enough,
    consider choosing 2 drum parts instead and make combis yourself to circumvent the 6 note limit.
    Note that the new Xtra combi sounds cannot be listened to as solo drum sound, but you can still listen solo to the whole drum part.
- Note pruning down to 6 for drum is now less arbitrary. Louder notes are prioritized and bass notes too.
    Note that pruned drum notes is not shown in yellow even if that feature is enabled.
- Made a new comment field in each part that tells which lotro instrument it was made for (%%made-for).
    Since transcribers might not use the instrument-name when they name a part, or use it in another language,
    this is added so can choose the right instrument in AbcPlayer and Maestro when loading abc files, less guessing.
    Only forward compatible. If loading old abc files, it will work the old way with guessing from %%part-name or part title (T:).
- Made sure peak counter is reset when opening new song. But if notes from previous song is still in decay phase then they might increase the counter anyway.
- Changed font of polyphony counter.
    
Version 2.5.0.83
- Fix that 64 bit Maestro and AbcPlayer would not open a different file when already running if initialized by double-clicking in Windows.

Version 2.5.0.82
- Made 64 bit the default version.
- Removed support for 32 bit.
- Included more samples for Horn and Bagpipe.
- Polyphony counter now also shows peak concurrent playing notes. Suggested by Jersiel.
    But do remember again that due to technical reasons Maestro note fadeout time is longer than in lotro,
    and since notes in fadeout phase is counted, the polyphony numbers have a tendency to be too high.
- German and French words for 'center', 'left' and 'right' in part titles will now also change stereo pan.
    The words recognized is now: left, links, gauche, right, rechts, droite, middle, center, zentrum, mitte and centre.
    Upper or lower case does not matter.
- Added support for Songbook variants based on The Badgers Chapter.
    It can output title, genre and mood.
    There is also an option to output all parts played for convenience.
    There is no way to select individual parts to be played though, to do that have to use songbrowser.exe

Version 2.5.0.81
- Maestro now accept karaoke midi files with .kar ending.
- Added Close Project to main file menu. Suggested by Paane.
- Polyphony counter now goes orange above 54 notes. Suggested by Jersiel. Will still go red at 64+.
- Fixed that rare MIDIs with very low Pulse Per Quarter Note (PPQ) resolution could change note and rest lengths in non-swing mode and in mix timings mode.
    The fix makes the output in sync and correct tempo when using non-swing timing or mix timing or both.
    It does however not solve the imprecise timings of such MIDI when converted to ABC.
    I suggest for such MIDI, edit them to a finer resolution (for example PPQ of 480) in a MIDI editor.
    Thank you to Jersiel for hearing the issue in the first place.
- Fixed that final rest in a abc part would start where the event that began last would end,
    instead of be sure to pick the event that actually ended last and use that ending.
- Fixed that the very last chord of a abc part would not be broken up and tied,
    but instead would just be output even if notes in had different lengths.
    Lotro would not complain, but for consistency it will now also be broken up and tied. 

Version 2.5.0.80
- ABC preview in Maestro will now work with 15 parts instead of just 14.
- ABC preview might work with more than 15 parts, if certain conditions are met.
    Maestro internally uses midi to play the preview.
    When you make a song with more than 15 parts, it will try to combine parts
    using 2 methods in order to share midi channels of which there is a limited number.
    If unsuccesful, then an error message will pop up when preview is in ABC mode. 
    There is an absolute max of 24 parts due to Lotro's raid maximum.
    AbcPlayer and Maestro still wont play ABC files that have more than 14 parts,
    it only works for preview when source is a midi file. Might work on this in future version.

Version 2.5.0.79
- Added option to show polyphony count while previewing abc song. See tooltip in options for more info.
- In the delay dialog the time can now be entered using comma as decimal point. Suggested by Notenzauber.
- In XG, GM2 or GS midis, drums tracks will no longer get assigned some random GM instrument voice.
    They will be named "XG Drums", "GM2 Drums" or "GS Drums", and will some times still sound wrong when playing the midi.
    But now at least they will be marked as drum track so people don't assign melodic instruments on them.
- Added support for showing GS, XG and GM2 instrument and drum kit names. If it does not know the name then it fall back to GM name.
    Number of known instrument and kit names has gone from 129 to 2446 in total.
    The name lists was compiled mostly by github.com/jazz-soft and then edited and expanded by me.

Version 2.5.0.76
- Change preview dynamics for +pppp+ to same as +ppp+ to match Lotro.
- Include x3 times as many horn samples to make it sound more like Lotro.

Version 2.5.0.75
- Fixed that a MIDI Note ON event after a Note ON for same pitch, would remove the first Note ON event if the second had non-zero velocity.

Version 2.5.0.74
- Mix Timings now no longer consider section silenced notes when determining rhythm.
- When a Lotro instrument part stop using a section edited track, also stop visualizing the section edits, even though it remembers them.
- Fix that when attempting to load a Maestro Project that has parts assigned to MIDI tracks that does no longer exist in the MIDI,
    Maestro would sometimes give the user no feedback on why it does not open. It was due to flooding of whitespaces to main Maestro window,
    which forced the important message out of view.

Version 2.5.0.73
- Mix Timings is now enabled per default for new projects.
- Will now export swing/mix timing checkbox settings to abc file as comments.

Version 2.5.0.72
- Octave doubling will now show visually in the notegraph also.
    This is helpful for evaluating out of range notes.
- Less interruptions in very long sustained notes (up to 5s).
- Improved Mix Timings algorithm near tempo-changes.
- For drum parts Mix Timings now only use note start times, not end times for evaluating rhythm.

Version 2.5.0.71
- Fixed that after loading a Maestro Project from .msx file, existing drum-parts would not instantly update the preview audio when individual drum notes were changed.

Version 2.5.0.70
- Added checkbox for Mix Timings, where it will do parts of song in swing/triplet/even timings depending on the detection of note rhythms.
    This is instrument-part independent, it might put notes on swing rhythm on the flute while at the same time keeping even rhythm on drums.
    If that is enabled then the old triplet/swing checkbox will still set the default grid for majority of the song. So remember to still
    set the triplet/swing checkbox to what most of the song conforms to.
    One drawback is that with Mix Timings enabled you can no longer reliable hand-edit the .abc file and copy-paste bars. A bar might not be 100%
    matching duration of same bar in other parts, or exports with different timing settings (this is a ABC cosmetic issue only, the notes will play at correct time). So be careful with editing.
- Fixed that if sections were not entered in order, the green background coloring of the track would not cover all sections.

Version 2.5.0.69
- Added ability for octave doubling of sections. Increased number of sections from 6 to 10.
    Note this will not be visible in the notegraph, but can be heard in abc preview. To visualize it, save to abc and load up the abc to inspect.
- Added option in section-editor to silence or octave double the parts of the track that is not covered by sections.
- Fixed regression of minimum tempo to 12bpm instead of Maestro standard 10bpm.

Version 2.5.0.68
- Enabled section editor for percussion also. (Cowbells, Drum, Student FX)
- The delays can now be heard in abc preview in Maestro.

Version 2.5.0.67
- Added student fiddle as an percussion instrument also, with only the noises. Student's FX Fiddle.

Version 2.5.0.66
- When breaking up long notes, allow them only to be 5s instead of 6s, as some samples are only around 5s long.
- When breaking up long notes, prioritize again to do it at bar boundaries if possible. Allow it to happen also at the first bar boundary it crosses though.
    Else break them close to 2.5s to still prevent rounding notes to zero duration.
- Reduced max meter denominator to 8 again to avoid divide by zero.
- Fixed that when loading up an ABC file into Maestro 64bit and not having volume at max, the volume could gradually become lower when skipping around while ABC previewing.

Version 2.5.0.65
- More tidy output of long rests while still preventing too long rests.

Version 2.5.0.64
- Better detection of when lotro determines minimum note duration by using 'equal to' vs 'greater than'.

Version 2.5.0.63
- Added a stereo slider, goes from mono to wide stereo panning for ABC preview.

Version 2.5.0.62
- Reinstated about half of the hold at end of notes for more mimic of lotro release.

Version 2.5.0.61
- Reverted back to 2.5.0 release envelope duration, as it was a better lotro approximation.
    Thanks to Pontin for good feedback and to Jersiel to spot that the sound issue in Pontin's video was in the note releases.

Version 2.5.0.60
- Built a .msi installer and 64-bit executables. 32 bit will still be the default that is run if you double click on MIDI, abc or msx files (unless you change it).

Version 2.5.0.59
- When exporting with changed tempo, the part description duration should now be correct.
- The prune algorithm now consider the highest and lowest notes in the chord as that from their pitch before they were compressed into 3 octaves.
    Thanks to Jersiel for inputting that this way makes more sense.
- Fixed an old bug that with some MIDIs could result in notes of duration zero seconds, which lotro would reject.
    The fix I did in 2.5.0.46 would actually allow this old bug to happen more often. But all good now, its fixed.
- The ZIP file now includes more files and install instructions has changes, scroll down to see them.

Version 2.5.0.58
- Readded all plucked samples to the .sf2 file to reduce CPU usage when previewing.

Version 2.5.0.57
- Enabled faster memory cleanup of map of discarded notes inside NoteEvents, and use less memory too.
- Reduced and changed which samples is shipped in the .sf2 file, to reduce memory usage.

Version 2.5.0.56
- Added possibility to add a delay up to 1 second on a part. (but only if tempo is higher or equal to 50 bpm)
    This can be used to get a chorus or echo effect by having two similar parts where one of them has a small delay.
    When you first click the Delay Part button below the instrument part list,
    the dialog will popup in upper left corner of your screen (like section editor will too).
- Section editor and Delay Part dialogs will now pop up where they were last closed.

Version 2.5.0.55
- Now the new 2.5.0.42 discard algorithm will play in preview also, instead of only happening during export to ABC.
- The discarded notes will now show as yellow when in Abc Preview if enabled in options.
- Zoom will now also zoom a little vertical.
- Fixed that ABC-Player would not detect too short or too long notes if tied. Also beautified the messages slightly.
- Section editors input lines no longer need to be in chronological order.

Version 2.5.0.53
- Fixed bug that sometimes would make Delete button greyed out after deleting an instrument part.
- Added two more tooltips.

Version 2.5.0.52
- Fixed that some rare MIDIs when changing tempo in Maestro and when in ABC Preview, would show a wrong total song duration.
    It would however always export the correct duration, only the displayed duration was affected.
- When a section has been silenced it will no longer visually show the volume of the silenced notes.

Version 2.5.0.51
- Allow to load a section from .msx file that does nothing. Sometimes its handy to have such section saved, when doing WIP.
    Bar numbers must still meet requirements though. Still only enabled sections will be saved.
- Centered the input numbers in the section editor.
- Now stores the edit line in section editor into the section data, to make it show on same line again. Also saves it in the .msx file.
- Added possibility for fade-in also. And fading is now adjustable in amount.
    A value of 0 mean no fading. 100 means full fade-out. -100 means full fade-in.
    Magnitudes larger than 100/-100, for example -150, will 'over-fade',
    meaning the fading will become so steep it takes place over less time than the section spans.
- Added show volume button in section editor. Press down and hold to see volumes in track.
- Added tooltips to section editor input fields.

Version 2.5.0.50
- Improved check for overlapping sections in section editor.

Version 2.5.0.49
- Fixed that if a drum track with drums was active while zooming in its drum notes could not be seen.
- Section editor will now disable bad input when clicking on APPLY. Plus added more info text.

Version 2.5.0.48
- Fixed that zoom button sometimes would not work.

Version 2.5.0.47
- Added a zoom button in lower right corner.
- Reverted the fix for bar maximum counter and expanded its tooltip info.
	Seems some songs it worked for, and some only for the MIDI preview and not for the ABC preview.
	Further investigation is needed for better fix.

Version 2.5.0.46
- Fix for very slow songs with long bars (for example 50bpm 2/2) could sometimes export a rest longer than 8s, which would make lotro refuse to play it.

Version 2.5.0.45
- Added option to fadeout specific sections.
- Optimized some code in section handling.
- Fixed that bar counter maximum in Maestro and ABC Player would show one too much.

Version 2.5.0.44
- Added option to change volume of specific sections of a track.
	How much the number affects the volume depends on the notes volume in the MIDI and on what the volume slider for the track is set to.
	Its basically an MIDI velocity offset. Examples: -50, 10, 151 etc etc.
    Although MIDI only goes from 0-127 you can enter a greater number offset to also offset the track volume slider.
- Adjusted some instrument volumes.
	This was done by carefully using same velocity/note and comparing them against Lute of Ages. Done by recording in Audacity and check (normalized with lute A) difference between them in lotro and in Maestro.
	LM Fiddle, Basic fiddle, traveller's was changed. Have not checked cowbells, pibgorn, theo, drum, brusque, b.bassoon, st.fiddle yet. Ongoing work.

Version 2.5.0.43
- Allow time-signature denominator up to 32 from 8.
- Added option to change octave or silence specific sections of a track by clicking button next to volume slider.
	Using this with long songs with many parts might make Maestro less resposive, especially when preview is running.
- Improved the max 6 note discard algorithm by discarding non-sustainable instrument notes that have tie to previous note and already played past the 1.1s limit.

Version 2.5.0.42
- Fix for LOTRO failing playback with Note's duration is too short
- Removed stereo and reverb in Maestro ABC preview
    This will make it much easier to accurate judge the instruments volumes compared to each other.
- Export explicit unit note length to ABC output for good measure.
- Fixed a meter division that was cast in a non helpful way
- Made ABC Player check duration limits of rests also and those check is now made against actual note durations, not converted tempo changes in ABC file comment sections.
- When loading ABC file with non-abbreviated tuplets like for example '(3:2:3' it will now process it properly instead of failing.
- MIDI instrument names now more in line with official specification.
- Preview note endings now sound more in line with lotro's way of ending notes. Was careful measured, should be fairly accurate.
- The soundfont now contains all pibgorn and clarinet notes. Reason is that they vary alot in quality and that should be heard in preview to not make songs more beautiful than lotro renders them.
    This will make the soundfont file slightly larger though and make Maestro consume more memory.
- Track panel title tooltip will now show count of bad clarinet/pibgorn notes.
    To see this, select pibgorn or clarinet, and hover mouse over a track title.
- Lotro has a max 6 notes played at the same time per instrument. The way notes are discarded is now done with a much smarter algorithm instead of often discarding the highest pitched notes.
    This feature is very very handy for solo and small bands, where multiple tracks often is combined into same instrument.
    Jersiel co-developed the algorithm for this.

FAQ
===
Will the upgraded Maestro .msx files load into old 2.5.0 Maestro?

- Yes, but the section edits, tune edits, Student FX, mix timing, Badger Chapter metainfo and delays will be ignored. Combi drum sounds will be silenced. And more than 15 parts wont be previewed.


Will these upgrades eventually be merged into Digero's code?

- Might happen if he wants that. For now I just use it myself and give it to whomever wants it.


I get a crash, how can I find out what caused it?

- Start Maestro from commandline with: java -d64 -jar Maestro.jar
  It should then output a stacktrace when crashing. If unsure on how to read it, just send to me.


After having put Windows to sleep while Maestro were running the preview starts to sound uneven, there is preview delays. How to fix?

- Save your work, close Maestro and reopen it. Its best to close Maestro before putting Windows to sleep.


Can I compile the programs myself, can I get the source-code?

- Yes its open-source, just ask.
